# Coffee machine

One evening I was too lazy to do something, then I'm implementing this. This program is my quick implementation of the coffee machine class with terminal I/O. So, don't expect much. It's only a fun project. But If you have never seen the C++ or want to write Makefile as general as possible, you can check it.

## Usage
Usage is simple at the start you must give the machine some coins (_decimal nubmers_) up to the price of coffee. The default price is 25. The coffee machine stores the coins for money back. If you paid too much and the machine has coins. Then give your money back. After that, you must wait for your coffee. Just write the word `wait`. If coffee is finished, you have to take it with the word `take`. That cycle runs again and again until you write `shutdown`.
